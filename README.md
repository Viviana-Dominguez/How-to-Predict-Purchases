# E-Commerce Insights: Predicting Customer Purchases
## Porject Overview
This project analyzes online customer behavior during the peak shopping months of November and December. The goal is to provide insights into customer browsing patterns and predict the likelihood of purchases using real-world e-commerce data. By identifying key customer segments and applying statistical techniques, this analysis helps estimate the potential success of a new marketing campaign for returning customers. This project also includes explanations of each step in the analysis, making it easy for others to follow along. You can use this as a guide to perform a similar analysis on your own dataset. The markdowns explain the thought process behind each step and can be adapted for different data sources or objectives.

## Techniques Used:
* Data Filtering: Focusing on sessions in November and December.
* Group Analysis: Identifying purchase rates by customer type (new vs. returning).
* Correlation Analysis: Finding the strongest correlation between various session duration variables.
* Binomial Probability: Estimating the likelihood of achieving sales targets based on a marketing campaign boost.

## Dataset
Source: The dataset used in this project is online_shopping_session_data.csv, which contains detailed information on each user's shopping session.
